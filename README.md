# Introduction
To try a Hello World-style CI (Continuous Integration) example on GitHub, using GitHub Actions is the simplest option. GitHub Actions is a CI/CD service provided by GitHub that allows you to automatically run tests, builds, deployments, and more whenever an event occurs in your repository.

# Coding Rules
1. Do not hard-code context into shell commands; instead, pass it through environment variables.
2. Enclose all environment variables in double quotes.
